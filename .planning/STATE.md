# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-24)

**Core value:** From an empty repo, an implementation agent can systematically rebuild all intended capabilities of this codebase with no hidden context.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 — File Contract Framework & Pilot Pass

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 8 (File Contract Framework & Pilot Pass)
Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase
Status: Ready to discuss
Last activity: 2026-02-24 — Phase 2 executed and verified (passed)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 25%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: 11.2 min
- Total execution time: 0.9 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Scope Policy, Inventory, and Guardrails | 3 | 32 min | 10.7 min |
| 2. Coverage Validation & Classification | 2 | 24 min | 12.0 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 12 min, 11 min, 9 min, 10 min, 14 min
- Trend: Stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Exclusions are governed by a canonical taxonomy (`.planning/specs/EXCLUSIONS.md`) referenced by inventory rules.
- Coverage completeness is proven via deterministic discovery-vs-inventory set diffs in `.planning/specs/COVERAGE-AUDIT.md`.
- Completeness claims require explicit evidence links (`COVERAGE-AUDIT.md`, `EXCLUSIONS.md`) in baseline/index artifacts.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Bun compatibility for PTY/process-heavy parity areas still needs focused validation in later planning phases.
