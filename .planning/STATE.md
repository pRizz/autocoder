# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-24)

**Core value:** From an empty repo, an implementation agent can systematically rebuild all intended capabilities of this codebase with no hidden context.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Full File-Level Contract Capture

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 8 (Full File-Level Contract Capture)
Plan: 0 of 4 in current phase
Status: Ready to discuss
Last activity: 2026-02-24 — Phase 3 executed and verified (passed)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 37.5%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 8
- Average duration: 11.4 min
- Total execution time: 1.5 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Scope Policy, Inventory, and Guardrails | 3 | 32 min | 10.7 min |
| 2. Coverage Validation & Classification | 2 | 24 min | 12.0 min |
| 3. File Contract Framework & Pilot Pass | 3 | 35 min | 11.7 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 10 min, 14 min, 11 min, 15 min, 9 min
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- File-spec schema and authoring conventions are now canonical prerequisites for all Phase 4 contract entries.
- Pilot matrix confirms representative coverage across backend/frontend/docs/workflow/script artifact classes.
- Pilot review explicitly confirms the framework is executable by regeneration agents for scale-out capture.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Bun compatibility for PTY/process-heavy parity areas still needs focused validation in later planning phases.
