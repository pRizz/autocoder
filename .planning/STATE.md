# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-24)

**Core value:** From an empty repo, an implementation agent can systematically rebuild all intended capabilities of this codebase with no hidden context.
**Current focus:** Phase 5 — Surface Contracts (API + WebSocket)

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 8 (Surface Contracts (API + WebSocket))
Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase
Status: Ready to discuss
Last activity: 2026-02-24 — Phase 4 executed and verified (passed)

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 12
- Average duration: 13.9 min
- Total execution time: 2.8 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Scope Policy, Inventory, and Guardrails | 3 | 32 min | 10.7 min |
| 2. Coverage Validation & Classification | 2 | 24 min | 12.0 min |
| 3. File Contract Framework & Pilot Pass | 3 | 35 min | 11.7 min |
| 4. Full File-Level Contract Capture | 4 | 76 min | 19.0 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 9 min, 21 min, 22 min, 22 min, 11 min
- Trend: Upward (larger scope plans)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Full file contract corpus now exists for all canonical inventory artifacts (237/237 coverage).
- Coverage ledger and quality audit are canonical pass/fail evidence gates for file-level completeness.
- Phase 5 surface-contract work must consume the Phase 4 corpus and audit artifacts as prerequisites.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Bun compatibility for PTY/process-heavy parity areas still needs focused validation in later planning phases.
