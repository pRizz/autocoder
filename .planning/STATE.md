# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-24)

**Core value:** From an empty repo, an implementation agent can systematically rebuild all intended capabilities of this codebase with no hidden context.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Coverage Validation & Classification

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Source + ops artifact coverage is governed by explicit include/exclude policy in `.planning/specs/POLICY.md`.
- Execution is docs-only; write scope is constrained to `.planning/**` with command-level guardrails.
- Canonical inventory IDs (`ART-####`) are required for downstream cross-references.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Bun compatibility for PTY/process-heavy parity areas still needs focused validation in later planning phases.
