# Exclusion Taxonomy Contract

**Status:** Active  
**Phase:** 02 (Coverage Validation & Classification)  
**Last updated:** 2026-02-24

## Objective

Define canonical exclusion classes for generated/runtime and tool-internal artifacts so coverage audits can distinguish intentional omissions from missing in-scope coverage.

## Class Matrix

| Class | Pattern | Rationale | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dependency install outputs | `venv/**`, `ui/node_modules/**` | Regenerated from dependency manifests; not authored source-of-truth | `venv/bin/python`, `ui/node_modules/react/index.js` |
| Build outputs | `ui/dist/**`, `*.tsbuildinfo` | Generated artifacts from build toolchain | `ui/dist/index.html`, `ui/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` |
| Interpreter/runtime caches | `**/__pycache__/**`, `*.pyc` | Transient bytecode/cache generated by interpreter | `api/__pycache__/database.cpython-*.pyc` |
| Runtime/debug emissions | `*.log` | Execution byproduct; non-deterministic content | `orchestrator_debug.log` |
| Package lock snapshots | `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lockb` | Generated lock state; excluded by current policy to reduce noise | `ui/package-lock.json` |
| Tool internals | `.git/**` | VCS metadata, not application behavior source | `.git/objects/*` |

## Decision Rules for Ambiguous Files

1. If a file can be regenerated from authored source/config in a normal setup path, classify it as excluded.
2. If a file is an authored input required to regenerate behavior/operations, classify it in scope.
3. If ambiguity remains, add a provisional entry to this document with rationale and resolve it in the next coverage audit run.

## generated/runtime Boundary Guidance

- Exclude generated/runtime artifacts even when they are present in repository snapshots.
- Include authored scripts/config/docs that control generation behavior.
- Never exclude an artifact class without documenting Class, Pattern, Rationale, and Examples.

## change-control

Exclusion changes are governed by this contract:

1. Any exclusion update must modify this file and `.planning/specs/INVENTORY-RULES.md` in the same plan.
2. Coverage audit artifacts must cite the change and include before/after impact on discovery counts.
3. New exclusion classes require at least one repository-specific example.

## Relationship to Inventory Rules

`.planning/specs/INVENTORY-RULES.md` is the procedural execution spec for discovery and classification.  
This file is the canonical exclusion rationale authority referenced by audits and reviews.
