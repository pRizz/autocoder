# Specification Scope Policy

**Status:** Active  
**Phase:** 01 (Scope Policy, Inventory, and Guardrails)  
**Last updated:** 2026-02-24

## Objective

Define unambiguous inclusion and exclusion boundaries for this repository's regeneration-spec initiative so all later artifacts use one canonical scope policy.

## Rationale

This policy ensures complete coverage of source + ops artifacts while excluding generated/runtime noise that does not represent authored product intent.

## In Scope

The following artifact classes are in scope for the spec corpus.

### 1. Application and Runtime Source
- Python service/runtime source: root `*.py`, `api/`, `server/`, `mcp_server/`, `lib/`
- Frontend source and app assets: `ui/` source/config files that define behavior
- CLI/runtime entrypoints and launchers: `start.py`, `start.sh`, `start_ui.py`, `start_ui.sh`, `start.bat`, `start_ui.bat`, `bin/`

### 2. Tests and Validation Assets
- Root Python tests: `test_*.py`
- Any repository test/config files that validate behavior

### 3. Operations, Documentation, and Governance
- Project docs: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `VISION.md`, `LICENSE.md`
- Planning/governance docs under `.planning/`
- Repository policies and contribution metadata

### 4. Build/Dependency/Execution Configuration
- Dependency manifests: `requirements.txt`, `requirements-prod.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`
- Git and CI metadata: `.gitignore`, `.npmignore`, `.github/workflows/*`
- Environment templates: `.env.example`

### 5. Non-TypeScript Supporting Artifacts
- Shell/batch scripts, CI workflows, markdown documentation, and configuration files
- Any non-generated file that is required to reproduce behavior or operation

## Out of Scope

The following artifact classes are explicitly excluded.

### 1. Generated, Build, and Runtime Outputs
- Python caches and compiled artifacts: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`
- JS dependency/build outputs: `ui/node_modules/`, `ui/dist/`
- Runtime/debug artifacts: `*.log` (for example `orchestrator_debug.log`)
- Temporary/transient outputs not authored as source of truth

### 2. Environment-Specific or Tool-Internal Data
- Virtual environment internals: `venv/`
- Git internals: `.git/`
- OS/editor transients (for example `.DS_Store`)

### 3. Third-Party Vendored Binaries/Packages
- Any downloaded package trees that are recreated by dependency install steps

## Scope Rules

1. Include source-of-truth artifacts authored by the project.
2. Exclude artifacts regenerated by tooling, runtime execution, or local environment setup.
3. If an artifact is ambiguous, classify it by reproducibility:
- Recreated deterministically from source/config: exclude.
- Required authored input for behavior/ops: include.
4. Inclusion/exclusion decisions are recorded in inventory docs; no silent reclassification.

## Repository-Specific Examples

### Included Examples
- `agent.py`
- `parallel_orchestrator.py`
- `server/main.py`
- `ui/package.json`
- `.github/workflows/*`
- `start.sh`
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md`

### Excluded Examples
- `venv/bin/python`
- `ui/node_modules/**`
- `ui/dist/**`
- `__pycache__/**`
- `orchestrator_debug.log`
- `.git/**`

## Relationship to Guardrails

This policy defines *what* must be covered.  
`.planning/specs/GUARDRAILS.md` defines *how* execution must proceed (docs-only writes under `.planning/**`).
