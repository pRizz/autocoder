# Milestone Audit: v1.0

## Executive Summary

Milestone v1.0 audit passed. All planned phases are verified, all v1 requirements are satisfied, cross-phase integration wiring is intact, and end-to-end readiness flows are complete.

## Scope and Inputs

- Project intent source: `.planning/PROJECT.md`
- Requirement authority: `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
- Phase plan/goal authority: `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
- Phase completion evidence: `.planning/phases/*/*-SUMMARY.md`
- Phase verification evidence: `.planning/phases/*/*-VERIFICATION.md`

## Phase Verification Table

| Phase | Verification Status | Score | Gaps | Anti-patterns |

## Requirements Coverage

| Family | Requirements | Result |
|---|---:|---:|
| INVT | 4 | 4/4 complete |
| GARD | 1 | 1/1 complete |
| FILE | 5 | 5/5 complete |
| SURF | 5 | 5/5 complete |
| MIGR | 5 | 5/5 complete |
| VERI | 4 | 4/4 complete |
| **Total** | **24** | **24/24 complete** |

## Cross-Phase Integration Check

Manual integration-checker fallback was executed using canonical handoff anchors in `INDEX.md` and verification artifacts.

| Integration Check | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 exports prerequisites for Phase 2+ | pass | `INDEX.md` Phase 1 completion section |
| Phase 3 exports prerequisites for Phase 4 | pass | `INDEX.md` Phase 3 completion section |
| Phase 4 exports prerequisites for Phase 5 | pass | `INDEX.md` Phase 4 prerequisite section |
| Phase 5 exports prerequisites for Phase 6 | pass | `INDEX.md` Phase 5 prerequisite section |
| Phase 6 exports prerequisites for Phase 7 | pass | `INDEX.md` Phase 6 prerequisite section |
| Phase 7 exports prerequisites for Phase 8 | pass | `INDEX.md` Phase 7 prerequisite section |
| Phase 8 reconstruction/readiness corpus is discoverable | pass | `INDEX.md` Reconstruction and Readiness Corpus |

## End-to-End Flow Check

| Flow Check | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `E01`..`E12` scenario suite exists (`12/12`) | pass | `PARITY-E2E-SCENARIOS.md` |
| API + WebSocket parity paths are represented | pass | `PARITY-E2E-SCENARIOS.md` + surface contracts |
| Data + process + security parity paths are represented | pass | `PARITY-E2E-SCENARIOS.md` + surface contracts |
| Final ready-to-regenerate gate is objective and blocker-aware | pass | `READY-TO-REGENERATE-GATE.md` |

## Gaps and Tech Debt

- Critical gaps: none
- Non-critical tech debt: none identified from phase verification reports
- Unverified phases: none

## Audit Decision

**Status: passed**

All milestone completion checks passed:
- Requirements coverage: 24/24
- Phase verification coverage: 8/8
- Cross-phase integration: 7/7
- End-to-end flow readiness: 4/4

Milestone is ready for completion/archival.
