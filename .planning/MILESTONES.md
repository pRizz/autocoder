### Delivered

- Established immutable scope policy, docs-only guardrails, and a canonical artifact inventory with stable `ART-####` IDs.
- Completed exhaustive file-level contract coverage across backend, frontend, and non-TypeScript operational assets (`237/237` reconciliation).
- Published full surface contracts for REST, WebSocket, data/persistence, process lifecycle, and security/policy semantics.
- Produced end-to-end TS/Bun/Solid parity mapping with discrepancy governance and risk controls.
- Published dependency-ordered reconstruction waves, full requirement acceptance traceability (`24/24`), and parity E2E scenarios (`12/12`).
- Finalized a blocker-aware, objective ready-to-regenerate go/no-go gate for from-scratch implementation execution.
