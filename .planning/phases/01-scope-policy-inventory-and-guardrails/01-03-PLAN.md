<objective>
Validate and lock the Phase 1 baseline for downstream contract-capture work.

Purpose: Ensure Phase 1 outputs are complete, coherent, and safe for subsequent phases.
Output: Coverage baseline report and finalized cross-links/guardrail checks.

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] test -f .planning/specs/COVERAGE-BASELINE.md
- [ ] rg -n "Phase 1 completion" .planning/specs/INDEX.md
- [ ] rg -n "Compliance checklist" .planning/specs/GUARDRAILS.md
- [ ] git diff --name-only | rg -v '^\.planning/' returns no output
