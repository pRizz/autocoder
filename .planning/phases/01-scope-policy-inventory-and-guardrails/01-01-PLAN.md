<objective>
Establish the authoritative policy baseline for the entire spec initiative.

Purpose: Prevent scope drift and accidental source edits before inventorying begins.
Output: Policy and guardrail documents plus a canonical specs index entrypoint.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Author scope policy contract</name>
  <files>.planning/specs/POLICY.md</files>
  <action>Create `.planning/specs/POLICY.md` defining in-scope artifact classes, out-of-scope generated/runtime classes, and rationale for each boundary. Include explicit examples from this repository so later plans do not reinterpret scope.</action>

  <name>Task 2: Author docs-only execution guardrails</name>

Before declaring plan complete:
- [ ] test -f .planning/specs/POLICY.md
- [ ] test -f .planning/specs/GUARDRAILS.md
- [ ] test -f .planning/specs/INDEX.md
- [ ] git diff --name-only | rg -v '^\.planning/' returns no output

<success_criteria>

- All tasks completed
- Scope policy and docs-only guardrails are explicit
- Specs index anchors later phase artifacts
- No source implementation files modified

After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-scope-policy-inventory-and-guardrails/01-01-SUMMARY.md`
